# Advanced Computer Science Coursework
Coursework that I retained from my time at Frisco ISD's Advanced Computer Science class by Mr. Page at the CTE Center. Unfortunately, 
due to my negligence, I forgot to retain my work for all the lessons. However, I did do all the lessons and was almost always ahead
of the due dates. I ended the year with a final grade of 99 from all 6 marking periods.
